            Amer Fort, situated in Amer, Rajasthan, India, is a historic
            fortification located 11 kilometers from Jaipur, the capital of
            Rajasthan. Covering an area of 4 square kilometers, Amer is renowned
            for its artistic style and stands as the primary tourist attraction
            in Jaipur. Positioned atop a hill, the fort boasts large ramparts,
            gates, and cobbled paths, providing scenic views of Maota Lake. This
            lake serves as the primary water source for the Amer Palace,
            enhancing the fort's significance and contributing to its
            picturesque surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amer Palace showcases exemplary Rajput and Mughal architectural
            influences. Crafted from red sandstone and marble, the opulent
            palace spans four levels, featuring the Diwan-e-Aam, Diwan-e-Khas,
            Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace or Jai Mandir), and Sukh Niwas. Notable
            for its artificial climate created by winds over a water cascade,
            the palace is often referred to as Amer Fort. Serving as the
            residence for Rajput Maharajas and their families, it includes a
            temple dedicated to Shila Devi near Ganesh Gate. The palace's design
            accommodates 12 rooms for Raja Man Singh's 12 queens, with separate
            staircases connecting to the king's room.
          </p>
          <p>
            Situated atop the Cheel ka Teela (Hill of Eagles) in the Aravalli
            range, Amer Palace and Jaigarh Fort form a connected complex. Linked
            by a subterranean passage, designed as an escape route during war,
            it facilitated the royal family's shift from Amer Fort to the more
            formidable Jaigarh Fort. Amer Palace attracts an annual tourist
            footfall of 1.4 million, with 5,000 visitors daily, according to the
            Department of Archaeology and Museums. Recognized for its historical
            significance, Amer Fort, along with other forts, was declared a
            UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013.

          <h1>History Of Fort:</h1>
          <p>
            Amber was a Meena state, ruled by a Susawat clan. After Kakil Deo
            defeated the Susawats he made Amber the capital of Dhundhar after
            Khoh. Kakil Deo was a son of Dulherai.
          </p>
          <p>
            In early times, the state of Jaipur was known as Amber or Dhundhar
            and was controlled by Meena chiefs of five different tribes. They
            were under suzerainty of the Bargurjar Rajput Raja of Deoti. Later a
            Kachhwaha prince, Dulha Rai, destroyed the sovereignty of Meenas and
            also defeated Bargurjars of Deoli and took Dhundhar fully under
            Kachwaha rule.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Amber Fort was originally built by Raja Man Singh. Jai Singh I
            expanded it in the early 1600's. Improvements and additions were
            made by successive rulers over the next 150 years, until the
            Kachwahas shifted their capital to Jaipur during the time of Sawai
            Jai Singh II, in 1727.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the medieval era, Amer was referred to as Dhundar, signifying
            a sacrificial mount in the western frontiers. Ruled by the Kachwahas
            from the 11th century to 1727 AD, the history of Amer is intimately
            connected to this dynasty. For nearly seven centuries, from 1037 AD
            until the capital's relocation to Jaipur, the Kachwahas established
            and ruled their empire from Amer. The city played a pivotal role in
            shaping the historical narrative of the Kachwaha rulers until the
            transition of the capital to Jaipur.

            The Palace is divided into six separate but main sections each with
            its own entry gate and courtyard. The main entry is through the
            Suraj Pol (Sun Gate) which leads to the first main courtyard. This
            was the place where armies would hold victory parades with their war
            bounty on their return from battles, which were also witnessed by
            the Royal family's womenfolk through the latticed windows.[24] This
            gate was built exclusively[clarification needed] and was provided
            with guards as it was the main entry into the palace. It faced east
            towards the rising sun, hence the name. Royal cavalcades and
            dignitaries entered the palace through this gate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jaleb Chowk is an Arabic phrase meaning a place for soldiers to
            assemble. This is one of the four courtyards of Amer Palace, which
            was built during Sawai Jai Singh's reign (1693–1743 AD). Maharaja's
            personal bodyguards held parades here under the command of the army
            commander or Fauj Bakshi. The Maharaja used to inspect the guards
            contingent. Adjacent to the courtyard were the horse stables, with
            the upper-level rooms occupied by the guards.

          <h1>Conservation:</h1>
          <p>
            Six forts of Rajasthan, namely, Amber Fort, Chittor Fort, Gagron
            Fort, Jaisalmer Fort, Kumbhalgarh and Ranthambore Fort were included
            in the UNESCO World Heritage Site list during the 37th meeting of
            the World Heritage Committee in Phnom Penh during June 2013. They
            were recognized as a serial cultural property and examples of Rajput
            military hill architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amer town, an essential gateway to Amer Palace, has transformed into
            a heritage town, relying on tourism with 4,000 to 5,000 daily
            visitors during peak season. Encompassing 4 square kilometers, the
            town features eighteen temples, three Jain mandirs, and three
            mosques. Recognized as one of the 100 endangered sites worldwide by
            the World Monument Fund (WMF), it benefits from the Robert Wilson
            Challenge Grant for conservation. In 2005, the fort housed around 87
            elephants, but some were reported to be suffering from malnutrition.
            The town's cultural richness and conservation efforts contribute to
            its significance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conservation works have been undertaken at the Amer Palace grounds
            at a cost of Rs 40 crores (US$8.88 million) by the Amer Development
            and Management Authority (ADMA). However, these renovation works
            have been a subject of intense debate and criticism with respect to
            their suitability to maintain and retain the historicity and
            architectural features of the ancient structures. Another issue
            which has been raised is the commercialization of the place.
          </p>

            During a film shoot at Amer Fort, a 500-year-old canopy was damaged,
            the old limestone roof of Chand Mahal was demolished, holes were
            drilled to install sets, and large quantities of sand were spread in
            Jaleb Chowk, violating the Rajasthan Monuments, Archaeological
            Sites, and Antique Act (1961). The Rajasthan High Court's Jaipur
            Bench intervened, halting the film shoot. The court observed that
            authorities, swayed by financial allurements, had turned a blind eye
            to the historical significance of protected monuments, highlighting
            the unfortunate trend of exploiting such sites for income.
