            The Chittorgarh (literally Chittor Fort), also known as Chittod
            Fort, is one of the largest forts in India. It is a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site. The fort was the capital of Mewar and is located in
            the present-day city of Chittorgarh. It sprawls over a hill 180 m
            (590.6 ft) in height spread over an area of 280 ha (691.9 acres)
            above the plains of the valley drained by the Berach River. The fort
            covers 65 historic structures, which include four palaces, 19 large
            temples, 20 large water bodies, 4 memorials and a few victory
            towers.

          <h1>History Of Fort:</h1>
          <p>
            Chittorgarh, originally called Chitrakut, is said to have been built
            by the western branch of the Mauryan ruler Chitrangada Mori. The
            fort's name is believed to be derived from its builder. Small
            Buddhist stupas dating back to the 9th century have been found near
            Jaimal Patta lake, adding to the historical richness of the region.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Guhila ruler Bappa Rawal is credited with capturing the fort of
            Chittor in either 728 CE or 734 CE. One account suggests that he
            obtained the fort as part of a dowry. Alternatively, according to
            other versions of the legend, Bappa Rawal seized the fort from the
            Moris. Historian R. C. Majumdar posits that the Moris were in
            control of Chittor when the Arabs invaded north-western India around
            725 CE. The Arabs defeated the Moris but were, in turn, defeated by
            a confederacy that included Bappa Rawal. R. V. Somani theorizes that
            Bappa Rawal may have been part of the army of Nagabhata I. However,
            some historians question the historicity of this legend, arguing
            that the Guhilas did not have control over Chittor until the reign
            of the later ruler Allata. The earliest Guhila inscription found at
            Chittor dates back to the mid-13th century during the reign of
            Tejasimha and mentions "Chitrakuta-maha-durga" (the great fort of
            Chittor).
          </p>
          <p>
            The siege of Chittorgarh in 1303, led by Alauddin Khalji of the
            Delhi Sultanate, resulted in the capture of the fort after an
            eight-month-long campaign. Historical accounts by Amir Khusrow
            mention a massacre of 30,000 local Hindus ordered by Alauddin after
            the conquest. While some legends suggest the invasion was to capture
            the queen Padmini, modern historians question the authenticity of
            these tales.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the conquest, Alauddin assigned Chittorgarh to his young
            son Khizr Khan, renaming the fort "Khizrabad." The administration
            was overseen by Malik Shahin due to Khizr Khan's young age.
            Subsequent rulers, including Rana Hammir, regained control, and
            Chittorgarh flourished again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rana Sanga's reign in the 15th century marked a resurgence of Rajput
            power, expanding Mewar's influence. However, after a series of
            victories, Rana Sanga faced defeat at the Battle of Khanwa against
            Babur, marking the establishment of Mughal rule in India.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1535, Chittorgarh faced another siege by Bahadur Shah, Sultan of
            Gujarat, resulting in the tragic jauhar (mass self-immolation) by
            Rajput women. The final siege in 1567 by Mughal Emperor Akbar led to
            the fall of Chittorgarh after a four-month-long struggle,
            culminating in jauhar and the fort's conquest. A peace treaty in
            1616 between Jahangir and Amar Singh resulted in Chittorgarh being
            returned to the latter. The fort underwent refurbishment in 1905
            during the British Raj.

          <h1>Architecture:</h1>
          <p>
            Chittorgarh Fort, located in the state of Rajasthan, India, is
            renowned for its impressive architecture and historical
            significance. The fort stands on a hilltop, covering a vast area and
            is surrounded by a series of walls and gates. Here are key features
            of the architecture of Chittorgarh Fort:
          </p>
          <p>
            Multiple Gates: Chittorgarh Fort is accessed through a series of
            seven gates, each with its own significance and name. The main gates
            include the Padan Pol, Bhairon Pol, and Hanuman Pol, each serving
            different purposes and showcasing unique architectural elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vijay Stambh (Victory Tower): One of the most iconic structures
            within the fort is the Vijay Stambh, a nine-story tower built by
            Maharana Kumbha in the 15th century. The tower is adorned with
            intricate carvings and sculptures, depicting scenes from Hindu
            mythology and the Rajput history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kirti Stambh (Tower of Fame): Another notable tower within the fort
            is the Kirti Stambh, dedicated to Jain Tirthankaras. It is a
            seven-story tower adorned with Jain sculptures and carvings,
            showcasing the influence of Jainism in the region.
          </p>
          <p>
            Palaces and Temples: The fort houses various palaces and temples
            that exhibit Rajput and Mewar architecture. The Rana Kumbha Palace,
            Padmini Palace, and Fateh Prakash Palace are examples of structures
            within the fort that showcase the opulence and architectural prowess
            of the Rajputs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jauhar Kund and Rani Padmini's Palace: The Jauhar Kund, where mass
            self-immolation (jauhar) took place during times of siege, is a
            significant historical site. Rani Padmini's Palace, associated with
            the legendary queen, is known for its architecture and strategic
            location offering panoramic views of the surrounding landscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            Water Reservoirs: Chittorgarh Fort features several water
            reservoirs, including Gaumukh Kund and Rana Kumbha's Palace Tank,
            which were crucial for the water supply during times of siege.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bassie and Towers: The fort has various bastions and towers
            strategically located along its walls, providing vantage points for
            defense and surveillance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Architecture from Different Periods: The fort reflects architectural
            styles from different periods of its history, ranging from the 7th
            century to the 19th century. The structures showcase a blend of
            Rajput, Mughal, and Jain architectural influences.

        <div class="elem-4 elem absolute-center">
          <h1>Precincts :</h1>
          <p>
            Precints is the area within the walls or perceived boundaries of a
            particular building or place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chittorgarh Fort, resembling the shape of a fish, spans 13 km in
            circumference and covers 700 acres. Its difficult approach involves
            a zig-zag ascent of over 1 km from the plains, crossing a limestone
            bridge over the Gambhiri River with ten arches. Dominated by two
            tall towers, the fort houses numerous palaces and temples within its
            precincts, some now in ruins. The fortification is surrounded by a
            13 km wall, making it nearly inaccessible due to a 45° hill slope.
            The ascent passes through seven gates, built by Rana Kumbha, named
            Paidal Pol, Bhairon Pol, Hanuman Pol, Ganesh Pol, Jorla Pol, Laxman
            Pol, and Ram Pol. The complex comprises 65 historic structures,
            including palaces, temples, memorials, and water bodies, reflecting
            two major construction phases in the 5th and 15th centuries. The
            fort's unique topography and architectural elements contribute to
            its significance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the palace complex situated on the highest and most
            secure terrain in the west of Chittorgarh Fort, several other
            significant structures were constructed during the second phase of
            its development. Notable among them are the Kumbha Shyam Temple,
            Mira Bai Temple, Adi Varah Temple, Shringar Chauri Temple, and the
            Vijay Stambh memorial. This construction phase, primarily attributed
            to the 15th century under the Sisodia Rajputs, showcases a
            relatively pure Rajput architectural style with minimal eclecticism,
            incorporating features like vaulted substructures borrowed from
            Sultanate architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fort's 4.5 km walls, integrated with circular enforcements, are
            crafted from dressed stone masonry in lime mortar, towering 500 m
            above the plain. Access to the fort is restricted by seven massive
            stone gates, flanked by hexagonal or octagonal towers, leading
            through narrow defense passages. The final gate grants entry into
            the palace area, featuring residential and official structures. The
            Rana Kumbha Mahal, the palace of Rana Kumbha, is a large Rajput
            domestic structure, incorporating the Kanwar Pade Ka Mahal and the
            later palace of the poet Mira Bai. Over subsequent centuries, the
            palace area expanded with additions like the Ratan Singh Palace
            (1528–1531) and Fateh Prakash, also known as Badal Mahal
            (1885–1930). These structures contribute to the rich architectural
            tapestry of Chittorgarh Fort.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Chittorgarh Fort predominantly features Hindu temples like the
            Kalikamata Temple (8th century), Kshemankari Temple (825–850),
            Kumbha Shyam Temple (1448), and Adbuthnath Temple (15th–16th
            century), it also hosts Jain structures such as Sattaees Devari,
            Shringar Chauri (1448), and Sat Bis Devri (mid-15th century).
            Notable Jain monuments include the Kirti Stambh (12th century) and
            Vijay Stambha (1433–1468), towering at 24 m and 37 m, ensuring
            visibility across the fort. Additionally, the fort houses a
            contemporary municipal ward with around 3,000 inhabitants near Ratan
            Singh Tank at the northern end of the property.
