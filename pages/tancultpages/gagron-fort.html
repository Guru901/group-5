            Gagron Fort, located in the Jhalawar district of Rajasthan, India,
            is a notable hill and water fort situated in the Hadoti region.
            Constructed in the twelfth century by Rajput king Bijaldev Singh
            Dod, the fort exemplifies a combination of hill and water
            fortification. Throughout its history, Gagron Fort was under the
            control of rulers such as Sher Shah and Akbar. Positioned at the
            confluence of the Ahu River and Kali Sindh River, the fort is
            surrounded by water on three sides and has a moat on the fourth
            side, earning it the name "Jaladurg" or Water Fort in
            Hindi/Rajasthani. Recognized for its historical and architectural
            significance, Gagron Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage
            Site in 2013 as part of the Hill Forts in Rajasthan.

          <h1>History Of Fort:</h1>
          <p>
            Gagron Fort, believed to have been constructed during the twelfth
            century by King Bijaldev, was under the rule of the Khinchi kingdom
            for approximately 300 years. Despite the precise construction date
            being shrouded in mystery, historians estimate that the fort's
            construction spanned from the seventh century to the fourteenth
            century. The fort's historical significance and architectural
            features contribute to its mystique, attracting attention and
            interest from historians and visitors alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final ruler of Gagron Fort was King Achal Das Khinchi. In a
            historical account from the medieval period, the fort faced an
            invasion by Muslim rulers from Malwa. In 1423, Sultan Hoshang Shah
            led an attack on the fort with a formidable army comprising 30
            thousand horsemen and 84 elephant riders. Realizing the overwhelming
            odds against him, Achal Das Khinchi chose not to surrender but
            fought valiantly until he lost his life, adhering to Rajput
            tradition. In the face of impending capture by the Sultan's forces,
            many women within the fort performed jauhar, a ritualistic
            self-immolation, to preserve their honor. Gagron Fort reportedly
            witnessed 14 battles and two instances of queens performing jauhar.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fort has also been conquered by Sher Shah and Akbar. Akbar also
            reportedly made this fort a headquarter and later gave it to
            Prathviraj of Bikaner as a part of his estate.
