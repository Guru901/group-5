            Jaisalmer Fort, an architectural masterpiece nestled in the
            enchanting city of Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, is a timeless wonder. This
            fort isn't just a relic of the past; it's a living testament to
            history. In a world where most ancient forts lay in silence,
            Jaisalmer Fort thrives as one of the exceedingly rare "living
            forts." This distinction places it in the exclusive company of
            Carcassonne, France.

          <h1>History Of Fort:</h1>
          <p>
            The fort was built in 1156, and is a proud chattel of the Bhati
            clan. Rawal Jaiswal was the founder of Jaisalmer city, and Jaisalmer
            fort was built in his reign. It is a 250 foot tall fort, which is
            protected by 30 feet long walls. The fort constitutes 99 bastions,
            amongst these 92 were built between 1633 and 1647. One can see the
            fusion of Islamic and Rajput architecture. There are 4 gateways to
            reach this fort i.e. Ganesh Pol, Akshya Pol, Suraj Pol and Hawa Pol.
            Jaisalmer Fort is situated on Trikuta Hill and had been the scene of
            many battles.

          <h1>Architecture:</h1>
          <p>
            This magnificent fort sprawls across a vast expanse, measuring 1,500
            ft in length and 750 ft in width, rising 250 ft above its
            surroundings. Its formidable triple-ring defense structure begins
            with a 15 ft tall outer wall at the base. The fort's upper bastions
            and towers create an inner defensive perimeter extending about 2.5
            miles. Boasting an impressive 99 bastions, with 92 built or
            extensively reconstructed between 1633 and 1647, it stands as a
            testament to architectural prowess. The fort's four fortified
            entrances from the townside, one of which was once guarded by a
            cannon, showcase its strategic design.

          <h1>How It Is Today:</h1>
          <p>
            Today, the Jaisalmer Fort confronts numerous threats due to
            population growth. Challenges include water seepage, a lack of civic
            amenities, dilapidated structures, and seismic activity around
            Trikuta Hill. Unique in its construction atop weak sedimentary rock,
            the fort's foundation is vulnerable to seepage, resulting in the
            deterioration of significant sections, including the Queen's Palace
            (Rani Ka Mahal) and parts of the outer boundary wall and lower
            pitching walls.
