            Junagarh Fort, located in Bikaner, Rajasthan, India, has a rich
            history dating back to the fifth century BC when it was ruled by
            Raja Dhaj, Ror Kumar. Originally named Chintamani, the fort was
            later renamed Junagarh, meaning "Old Fort" in the early 20th century
            when the ruling family shifted to Lalgarh Palace outside the fort
            limits. Unlike many forts in Rajasthan, Junagarh is not built on a
            hilltop. The fort has played a central role in shaping the modern
            city of Bikaner, and its historical significance contributes to the
            city's development around it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fort complex was built under the supervision of Karan Chand, the
            Prime Minister of Raja Rai Singh, the sixth ruler of Bikaner, who
            ruled from 1571 to 1611 AD. Construction of the walls and associated
            moat commenced in 1589 and was completed in 1594. It was built
            outside the original fort of the city (the first fort built by Rao
            Bikaji), about 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) from the city centre. Some
            remnants of the old fort are preserved near the Lakshmi Narayan
            temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historical records reveal that despite the repeated attacks by
            enemies to capture the fort, it was not taken, except for a lone
            one-day occupation by Kamran Mirza. Kamran was the second son of the
            Mughal Emperor Babur who attacked Bikaner in 1534, which was then
            ruled by Rao Jait Singh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spanning 5.28 hectares, the Junagarh Fort precinct is adorned with
            palaces, temples, and pavilions. Within this expansive space, a
            blend of architectural styles reflects a composite culture,
            showcasing the diverse influences and historical layers that
            contribute to the fort's rich heritage.

          <h1>History Of Fort:</h1>
          <p>
            Before the construction of the present Junagarh Fort, a stone fort
            was erected in 1478 by Rao Bika, the second son of Maharaja Rao
            Jodha, founder of Jodhpur. Bika, unable to inherit his father's
            territory, established his kingdom at Bikaner in the region known as
            "Jungladesh." The city, deemed an oasis on the trade route between
            Central Asia and the Gujarat coast, prospered due to adequate spring
            water sources. Bikaner's fortunes flourished under Raja Rai Singhji,
            the sixth ruler, who accepted Mughal suzerainty and played a
            prominent role in their court. Rai Singhji's successful war exploits
            and jagirs granted him significant revenue, enabling the
            construction of Junagarh Fort. The fort's formal foundation ceremony
            occurred on February 17, 1589, and its completion was marked on
            January 17, 1594. Rai Singhji's expertise in arts and architecture
            is evident in the fort's design, making it an outstanding example of
            composite architecture and a unique artistic center in the Thar
            desert.

          <h1>Architecture:</h1>
          <p>
            This magnificent fort sprawls across a vast expanse, measuring 1,500
            ft in length and 750 ft in width, rising 250 ft above its
            surroundings. Its formidable triple-ring defense structure begins
            with a 15 ft tall outer wall at the base. The fort's upper bastions
            and towers create an inner defensive perimeter extending about 2.5
            miles. Boasting an impressive 99 bastions, with 92 built or
            extensively reconstructed between 1633 and 1647, it stands as a
            testament to architectural prowess. The fort's four fortified
            entrances from the townside, one of which was once guarded by a
            cannon, showcase its strategic design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Karan Singh, who reigned from 1631 to 1639 under Mughal suzerainty,
            constructed the Karan Mahal palace. Subsequent rulers, including
            Anup Singh (1669–98), expanded the fort complex, adding new palaces
            and the Zenana quarter. Anup Singh renovated Karan Mahal,
            transforming it into the Anup Mahal with a Diwan-i-Am (public
            audience hall). Gaj Singh (1746–1787) refurbished the Chandra Mahal
            (Moon palace), and Surat Singh (1787–1828) adorned the audience hall
            with glass and vibrant paintwork. Dungar Singh (1872–1887) built the
            Badal Mahal (Weather palace), depicting falling rain and clouds.
            Ganga Singh (1887–1943) contributed the Ganga Niwas Palace, designed
            by Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob. Ganga Singh's son, Sadul Singh,
            succeeded him in 1943 but acceded to the Union of India in 1949,
            passing away in 1950.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bikaner fell under the suzerainty of the British Raj through a
            treaty signed in 1818, prompting the Maharajas of Bikaner to invest
            significantly in the renovation of Junagarh fort. However, in the
            18th century, before the treaty, internal conflicts erupted between
            Bikaner and Jodhpur rulers, as well as among other Thakur. British
            troops intervened to quell these disputes. During an attack by the
            Jodhpur army, the fort's eastern entrance and southern rampart
            suffered damage, evidenced by cannonball marks on the southern
            facade.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ganga Singh, a prominent king among the Rajasthan princes, stood out
            as a favorite of the British Raj, earning the title of Knight
            Commander of the Star of India. His significant contributions
            included serving on the Imperial War Cabinet, representing the
            country at the Imperial First World War Conferences and the
            Versailles Peace Conference. Despite his awareness of the shifting
            fortunes in World War II, he passed away in 1943 before its
            conclusion. Ganga Singh played a crucial role in Junagarh's building
            activity, adding separate halls for public and private audiences in
            the Ganga Mahal and a durbar hall for formal functions. The Lalgarh
            Palace, designed by Swinton, became his new residence in 1902, and
            the royal family still resides there, having converted it into a
            heritage hotel.

          <h1>How It Is Today:</h1>
          <p>
            Today, the Jaisalmer Fort confronts numerous threats due to
            population growth. Challenges include water seepage, a lack of civic
            amenities, dilapidated structures, and seismic activity around
            Trikuta Hill. Unique in its construction atop weak sedimentary rock,
            the fort's foundation is vulnerable to seepage, resulting in the
            deterioration of significant sections, including the Queen's Palace
            (Rani Ka Mahal) and parts of the outer boundary wall and lower
            pitching walls.
