            Kumbhalgarh (literally "Kumbhal fort"), also known as the Great Wall of India, is a Mewar fortress on the westerly range of Aravalli Hills about 48 km from Rajsamand city in the Rajsamand district of the Rajasthan state in western India. It is located about 84 km from Udaipur. It is a World Heritage Site included in Hill Forts of Rajasthan. It was built during the 15th century by Rana Kumbha.
          </p>
          <p>In 2013, at the 37th session of the World Heritage Committee held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Kumbhalgarh Fort, along with five other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the group Hill Forts of Rajasthan.</p>

          <h1>History Of Fort:</h1>
          <p>
            Before the imposing fort built by Rana Kumbha, historical evidence remains scarce. In the shadows of uncertainty, a small stronghold called Matsyendra Durg was said to have existed, attributed to King Samprati of the Maurya. The expansion of this terrain unfolded in the late 14th century, as Rana Lakha strategically claimed the Godwar plains from the Chauhan Rajputs of Nadol. The fort's early history is a quiet enigma, patiently awaiting discovery.
          </p>
          <p>Kumbhalgarh, as the fort we see it was built by Rana Kumbha who was the Rana of Mewar from the Sisodia rajput clan. Rana Kumbha took the aid of the famous architect of the era, "Mandan". Rana Kumbha's kingdom of Mewar stretched from Ranthambore to Gwalior and included large tracts of what is now Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Out of the 84 forts in his dominion, Rana Kumbha is said to have built 32 of them, of which Kumbhalgarh is the largest and most elaborate.</p>
          <p>Kumbhalgarh also separated Mewar and Marwar from each other and was used as a place of refuge for the rulers of Mewar at times of danger. A notable instance was in the case of Prince Udai, the infant king of Mewar who was smuggled here in 1535, when Chittor was under siege. Prince Udai later succeeded to the throne. The fort remained impregnable to direct assault.</p>
          <p>Ahmed Shah I of Gujarat attacked the fort in 1457, but found the effort futile. There was a local belief then that the Banmata deity in the fort protected it and hence he destroyed the temple. There were further attempts in 1458–59 and 1467 by Mahmud Khalji, but it also proved futile. Akbar's general, Shahbaz Khan, attacked this fort in October 1577 and after the siege of 6 months, he was able to capture the fort in April 1577. But it was recaptured by Pratap in 1578. In 1818, an armed band of sanyasis formed a garrison to protect the fort, but was convinced by James Tod and the fort was taken over by the British and later returned to Udaipur State. There were additions made by Maharanas of Mewar, but the original structure built by Maharana Kumbha remains. The residential buildings and temples are well-preserved.The fort is also known to be the birthplace of Maharana Pratap.</p>

            Situated atop a hill at 1,100 m (3,600 ft) above sea level on the Aravalli range, Kumbhalgarh Fort boasts perimeter walls stretching 36 km (22 mi), ranking among the world's longest. The frontal walls stand at 4.5 m (15 ft), and the fort features seven fortified gateways. Inside, the fort hosts over 360 temples, encompassing both Jain and Hindu traditions.

                <p>
                  Aaret Pol was the first entry gate of the fort. Halla Pol is on the downward slope from the entrance. Just after Halla Pol is Badshahi Bavdi, a stepped tank, built after the invasion of Shahbaz Khan in 1578, the general of Mughal emperor Akbar to provide water to the troops.

                <p>Hanuman Pol, the next gate is half a KM away from Halla Pol. Hanuman Pol is a double-storeyed gate with octagonal bastions. The gate got its name from the stone image of Hanuman located in front of the gate, which was brought by Maharana Kumbha.</p>
                <p>Ram Pol is the main entrance of the fort, there is another entrance towards the east, called Vijay Pol.</p>
